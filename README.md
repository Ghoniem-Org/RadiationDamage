# Radiation Damage
Comprehensive repository for solving a system of ODEs for the Radiation Damage problem. Repository is organized as follows:

`Bubbles`
: Contains cpp code for solving the Bubbles ODEs with no spatial dimensions using Sundials. Refer to README inside the directory for details.

`Creep`
: Contains cpp code for solving the Creep ODEs with using Sundials.

`PlasmaMataerialInteraction`
: Contains cpp code for solving the Bubbles ODEs with spatial dimensions with using Sundials. Includes simulation results from SRIM. Refer to README inside `Bubbles_spatial` for details.

`PythonValidation`
: Legacy code for solving the Bubbles, Creep ODEs with matlab and python.
